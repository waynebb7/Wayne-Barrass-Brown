    There’s a planetarium on the top floor; an outdoor area gives you a fantastic view of the city.
    
    You might not expect to see exhibits of musical instruments and technical toys, but this museum has them. For people who like hands-on exhibits, there’s an entire area where you can do simple physics experiments. The museum even has a working DNA lab!
