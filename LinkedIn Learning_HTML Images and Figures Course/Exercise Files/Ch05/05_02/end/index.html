  <h1>Buying a Metro Ticket in Tokyo</h1>
  <p>
    <small>Disclaimer: This is entirely fictional. Any resemblance to actual ticket machines
    in Tokyo or any other city is purely coincidental.</small>
  </p>
  
  <p>
    Every station on the Tokyo Metro system will have a ticket vending machines. Here’s how to use them:
  </p>

  <ol>
    <li>
      <p>Select the language you wish to use.</p>
      <figure>
        <img src="images/step1.png" width="238" height="141"
          alt="Flags of Japan, US/UK, France, and China/Taiwan with language names in native language"/>
        <figcaption>Language selection screen</figcaption>
      </figure>
    </li>

    <li>
      <p>Select the type of pass you want. If you are going to be in Tokyo for more than three days, we recommend a weekly pass; the convenience of <em>not</em> having to buy a new
      ticket every day outweighs the extra cost.</p>
      <figure>
        <img src="images/step2.png" width="238" height="141"
          alt="Prices: Single trip: 100¥, day pass: 500¥, weekly 2200¥, monthly 9800¥"/>
        <figcaption>Ticket type selection screen</figcaption>
      </figure>
    </li>

    <li>
      <p>Select the number of adult and child tickets you want, using the arrows to
      increase or decrease the number. Children are people from age 2 to 15; children
      below the age of 2 ride free.</p>
      <figure>
        <img src="images/step3.png" width="238" height="141"
          alt="Number of adults / children, with plus and minus arrow keys next to number"/>
        <figcaption>Number of tickets selection screen</figcaption>
      </figure>
    </li>

    <li>
      <p>Finally, insert payment. Coins and bills go in on the left; you may use a debit card or credit card in the slot at the right. Tickets are dispensed in the bin at the bottom of the payment area.</p>
      <figure>
        <img src="images/step4.png" width="238" height="141"
          alt="Coin and bill slots at left, credit card slot at right, hinged box on bottom"/>
        <figcaption>Ticket machine payment area</figcaption>
      </figure>
    </li>
  </ol>
