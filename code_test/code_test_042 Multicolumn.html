        <h1>Let me try out the Multicolumn Spec</h1>
        <p>The goal is to cultivate in our hearts the concern a dedicated mother feels for her child, and then focus it
            on more and more people and living beings. This is a heartfelt, powerful love. Such feelings give us a true
            understanding of human rights, that is not grounded just in legal terms, but rooted deeply in the heart.</p>

        <p>If we think only of ourselves, forget about other people, then our minds occupy very small area. Inside that
            small area, even tiny problem appears very big. But the moment you develop a sense of concern for others,
            you realize that, just like ourselves, they also want happiness; they also want satisfaction. When you have
            this sense of concern, your mind automatically widens. At this point, your own problems, even big problems,
            will not be so significant. The result? Big increase in peace of mind. So, if you think only of yourself,
            only your own happiness, the result is actually less happiness. You get more anxiety, more fear.</p>

        <p>I love friends, I want more friends. I love smiles. That is a fact. How to develop smiles? There are a
            variety of smiles. Some smiles are sarcastic. Some smiles are artificial-diplomatic smiles. These smiles do
            not produce satisfaction, but rather fear or suspicion. But a genuine smile gives us hope, freshness. If we
            want a genuine smile, then first we must produce the basis for a smile to come.</p>

        <p>Whether we like it or not, we have all been born on this earth as part of one great human family. Rich or
            poor, educated or uneducated, belonging to one nation or another, to one religion or another, adhering to
            this ideology or that, ultimately each of us is just a human being like everyone else: we all desire
            happiness and do not want suffering. Furthermore, each of us has an equal right to pursue these goals.</p>

        <p>We have bigger houses but smaller families. More conveniences, but less time. We have more degrees, but less
            sense. More knowledge, but less judgment. More experts, but more problems. More medicines, but less
            healthiness. We've been all the way to the moon and back, but have trouble crossing the street to meet the
            new neighbor. We build more computers to hold more information to produce more copies than ever but have
            less communication. We have become long on quantity, but short on quality. These are times of fast foods but
            slow digestion; Tall man but short character; Steep profits but shallow relationships. It's a time when
            there is much in the window, but nothing in the room.</p>

        <p>It is time to develop a big 'US', rather than the old 'us and them' that lets us to exploit and bully others
            on a personal level, and on an international level to wage war. The East must see the West as part of 'US'
            and the North must come to feel that the South is part of 'US'. We should include the entire world in our
            concern, wishing all humanity well. If we can do that there will be no room for hatred, thinking of others
            as enemies. And we will achieve this through education, not through prayer.</p>

        <p>Warm-heartedness reinforces our self-confidence giving us not a blind confidence, but a sense of confidence
            based on reason. When you have that you can act transparently, with nothing to hide! Likewise, if you are
            honest, the community will trust you. Trust brings friendship, as a result of which you can always feel
            happy. Whether you look to the right or the left, you will always be able to smile.</p>

        <p>With the ever growing impact of science on our lives, religion and spirituality have a greater role to play
            reminding us of our humanity. There is no contradiction between the two. Each gives us valuable insights
            into the other. Both science and the teachings of the Buddha tell us of the fundamental unity of all things.
        </p>

        <p>I don't know whether the universe, with its countless galaxies, stars and planets, has a deeper meaning or
            not, but at the very least, it is clear that we humans who live on this earth face the task of making a
            happy life for ourselves. Therefore, it is important to discover what will bring about the greatest degree
            of happiness.</p>
